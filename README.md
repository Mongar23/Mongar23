## Sort story about my self
Hi, my name is Mathias Bevers, I am a 20 y.o. game-programmer student from the Enschede area. Currently, I am in my last year of the game developer(MBO 4) study. The focus of this study is to develop games in Unity3D. I'm very enthusiastic about developing games and exploring new programming topics. I am planning to continue studying at Saxion CMGT.
